## 🔬 Abstract

We investigate macroscopic models of traffic flow based on conservation laws and extend the classical Lighthill–Whitham–Richards (LWR) model using quasi-linear hyperbolic PDEs. The project introduces a basic simulator written in Java and analyzes traffic dynamics using Fourier transforms and stochastic wave behavior. The research compares numerical schemes like Lax-Friedrichs and WENO5 and proposes future improvements in real-time and data-driven traffic modeling systems.
